## Design

### Colour Palette
![Project Colour Palette](documentation/colour_palette.png)

### Imagery
The imagery on the site is intended to provide an evening sky or outer space feeling because the specific game with the introduction of Lizard and Spock was made famous by a sitcom entitled The  [Big Bang Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIpmITBocfM)

The background image for mobile screens offers a nigh sky theme and is very lightweight on bandwidth, while the larger screens will show an image of the evening sky with a much higher resolution.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop displays
- [Wireframe export](documentation/wireframs_mobile_desktop.pdf)


### Typography
Google Fonts was used to provide the following font family for the project:
- Marienda

I chose this font because it is a modern fun font, although it is a cursive font, it still makes for easy reading.

## Features

### General Features

The website consists of a single page which allows a user to start playing the game immediately.
Some timeout intervals have been set on the round result and game feedback to improve the user experience.
